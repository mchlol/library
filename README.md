Object constructor & prototype inheritance practice for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library).  

### Tools

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/)  

### Steps

1. Create basic html structure
2. Create an array to take users input and store new book objects into the array
3. Write a function to loop through the array and display each book object on the page
4. Add a "new book" button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: title, author, number of pages, and whether it has been read.
5. Add a button on each book's display to remove the book from the library  
  - You will need to associate your DOM elements with the actual book objects in some way. One easy solution is giving them a data-attribute that corresponds to the index of the library array.
6. Add a button on each book's display to change its `read` status.
 - To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a bookâ€™s read status on your Book prototype instance.
