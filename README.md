# Library - in progress

[WIP viewable here](https://mchlol.github.io/library/)

Object constructor & prototype inheritance practice for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)  
[Link to lesson instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library)   



### Tools

- HTML
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) for Tailwind CSS


## About

The aim of this project is to create a single page library app, where a user can add information about a book and have it appear on the page.  
One objective was to have a form popup on a button click, to enter the info, but I considered it better UX to have the form at the top of the page so it's more easily accessible, and more obvious how to add books to the library. However, I am no UX expert and it does take up precious library book space, plus it would be good practice to build and style a modal.  
I used TailwindCSS for the first time on this project, it's very cool and makes things like themes and toggles a lot easier, but I do prefer to write my own CSS so I really know what's going on (plus I might forget how).  


## Notes
Tailwind is great and all but I had a lot of trouble with the DaisyUI indicator classes. I used this to put the remove button on the top corner of each book, however it wreaked havoc on the rest of my styles. I ended up rewriting the class and putting it under the material icons size classes in the head of my html. Not ideal, maybe? But it worked a treat. ðŸ’ƒ 


### TO DO

- Fix duplicate book array issue - *fixed: clear the container first on calling the display function, then run the rest of the display function.*
- Add read toggle to book display - *fixed - new issue below*
- assign each book an id - *fixed - create a global variable and increment it on the book constructor so the id is always different and doesn't change when items are removed from the array*
- Add a remove book function - *fixed: created the button and it's corresponding function on the **constructor**, get the index of the item in the array, and remove it with splice()*
- change read status of book in library array on toggle - *fixed - created the toggle and function on the constructor - the function sets the read value to the opposite of itself on click*
- Center the library 'cards' in the container - *fixed-sort of: went through the two section classes and made sure they all matched. Haven't found a way to centre the grid children when there aren't enough to fill a row.*
- Create form popup modal
- Add a function to select & remove all selected books at once
- Add a function to sort books by read, no. of pages, or alphabetically etc.
